}
```
2. Please also add the following lines to your repositories section in your build.gradle:
```repositorys
maven {
    url 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/MicrosoftDeviceSDK/DuoSDK-Public/_packaging/Duo-SDK-Feed/maven/v1'
}
mavenCentral()
```
4. Create your MSAL configuration file 
The configuration file is a JSON file which can be saved from the portal website, more configuration information please refer to  [configuration file documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-configuration).
   
Create this JSON file as a "raw" resource file in your project resources. You'll be able to refer to this using the generated resource identifier when initializing.
Below the redirect URI please paste:
```single
"account_mode" : "SINGLE", 
```
Your config file should resemble this example:
```config
{ 
  "client_id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>", 
  "authorization_user_agent": "DEFAULT", 
  "redirect_uri": "msauth://<YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME>/<YOUR_BASE64_URL_ENCODED_PACKAGE_SIGNATURE>", 
  "account_mode": "SINGLE", 
  "broker_redirect_uri_registered": true, 
  "authorities": [ 
    { 
      "type": "AAD", 
      "audience": { 
        "type": "PersonalMicrosoftAccount", 
        "tenant_id": "consumers" 
      } 
    } 
  ] 
} 
```
